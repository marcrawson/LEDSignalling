# LEDSignalling

LEDSignalling encodes a string input into LED light patterns. Each letter has an ASCII interpretation and an assosiated LED interpretation and duration located in led-signals.asm.

LEDSignalling is written in AVR 2560 assembly language with compatability with Arduino Mega 2560 Microcontroller. The testing arduino has a row of 6 LEDs to display the program output.
